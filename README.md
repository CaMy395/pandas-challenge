Here is my Module 4 Challenge #pandas-challenge

Summarized Analysis

The results of the combined data provided various information including the averages across schools per subject, per grade, per enrolled student, budget per student, etc. This information can provide insight that can propose new questions and answer those questions. One conclusion that can be drawn is data for Holden High School's number of students with a grade over 70. This data looks like an outlier in this data set, but this can be explained by the total student count. Holden has the lowest enrollment which is why their averages and counts are lower. However, performance is on the higher end compared with the other schools. This could be due to smaller classes creating a more personal environment for the kids to learn better. Perhaps it also reduces distractions in the classroom. Another conclusion that can be drawn is that the grades across schools had similar averages for the math and reading scores. It can be assumed that the source that is being used to teach the students is similar and palatable.
